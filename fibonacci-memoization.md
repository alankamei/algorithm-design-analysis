# Algorithm: Finding the First `n` Fibonacci Numbers using Memoization

## Problem Statement

The task is to design an algorithm that finds the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:

- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- For all \( n \geq 2 \), \( F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) \)

The goal is to compute the Fibonacci sequence efficiently for values of `n` up to 1000.

## Algorithm Design

To solve the problem of finding the first `n` Fibonacci numbers efficiently, we can use **memoization**, a technique where we store the results of subproblems in an array (or memo table) to avoid redundant calculations. This method significantly improves the performance compared to the naive recursive approach.

### Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Initialize Memoization Table**:
   - Create a table (array) to store the results of Fibonacci numbers. Initially, set all values to `-1` to signify that they haven't been computed yet.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - Set `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1` as the base cases for Fibonacci numbers.

3. **Recursive Fibonacci Function**:
   - Define a recursive function `fibonacci(n)`:
     - If `memo[n]` is not `-1`, return the stored result.
     - Otherwise, compute the Fibonacci number recursively using the relation \( F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) \) and store the result in `memo[n]`.
     - This function will be called for each Fibonacci number from `0` to `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - After computing `fibonacci(n)`, print all Fibonacci numbers from `0` to `n` by calling `fibonacci(i)` for each value of `i`.

### Memoization

Memoization ensures that each Fibonacci number is computed only once. Once a Fibonacci number is computed, it is stored in the `memo` array and reused in subsequent calculations, thus reducing redundant calculations and improving performance.

## Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The naive recursive approach would involve recalculating the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times. However, with memoization, each Fibonacci number is calculated only once and stored for future use.
   
2. **Memoization Effect**:
   - The recursive function makes a maximum of `n` calls, each of which results in a constant amount of work (either retrieving a memoized result or performing a single addition).

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)** because:
     - Each Fibonacci number from `0` to `n` is computed only once.
     - There are `n` recursive calls, and each call takes constant time due to the memoization technique.

4. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(n)** because we use an array (`memo`) of size `n` to store the results of the Fibonacci numbers.

### Summary of Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)

This is a significant improvement over the naive recursive approach, which would have a time complexity of O(2^n) due to redundant recalculations.

## Conclusion

Using memoization to compute Fibonacci numbers is an efficient approach, reducing the time complexity from exponential to linear. This method allows us to generate Fibonacci numbers up to `n = 1000` efficiently, avoiding the exponential growth of recursive calls that would otherwise make the naive approach infeasible for larger values of `n`.
